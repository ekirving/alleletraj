		- redo with MAF >0.05
	
			- ~23.5 milllion which exist in dbsnp / ~3 million do not
				- what's the frequency?
			- ~350k are called as INDELs in dbsnp / not SNPs
				- +/- width of the bait
				
			- ~60k are polly in dbsnp / bi in my ascertainment
			- ~60k are bi in dbsnp / but alleles are different in my ascertainment
				- what's the frequency?
		
				- total = ~3.5 million problematic SNPs (13%)

			= is it okay to only call SNPs which are
				- SNVs
				- biallelic, and
				- the same alleles in dbsnp

		- include all MC1R snps
			- in all pigs (wild / dom / asian)
			- see http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000341

		- existing data
			
			- target SNPs with existing coverage? YES
			- also preference 60k Illumina SNPs

		- what about TV only

			- pros
				- less biased by damage patterns

			- cons
				- ??

			- david reich / check 'Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians' for what they did
				- ts = 80%
				- tv = 20%

					- We performed in-solution enrichment for a targeted set of 1,237,207
						SNPs using previously reported protocols4,7,43.  The targeted SNP
						set merges 394,577 SNPs first reported in ref. 7 (390k capture), and
						842,630 SNPs first reported in ref. 44 (840k capture).

						- To make analysis of large numbers of ancient DNA samples practical, we
							used in-solution hybridization capture10,11 to enrich next
							generation sequencing libraries for a target set of 394,577 single
							nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (‘390k capture’), 354,212 of which
							are autosomal SNPs that have also been genotyped using the
							Affymetrix Human Origins array in 2,345 humans from 203
							populations4,12.
						
						- (Patterson et al., 2012) REF 4 in Haak
						
							- The first 12 are based on a strategy used in Keinan et al. (2007),
								discovering SNPs as heterozygotes in a single individual of known
								ancestry for whom sequence data are available (from Green et al.
								2010; Reich et al. 2010) and then confirming the site as
								heterozygous with a different assay. After the validation steps
								described in File S1 (which serves as technical documentation for
								the new SNP array), we had the following number of SNPs from each
								panel: San, 163,313; Yoruba, 124,115; French, 111,970; Han, 78,253;
								Papuan (two panels), 48,531 and 12,117; Cambodian, 16,987;
								Bougainville, 14,988; Sardinian, 12,922; Mbuti, 12,162; Mongolian,
								10,757; Karitiana, 2,634. The 13th ascertainment consisted of
								151,435 SNPs where a randomly chosen San allele was derived
								(different from the reference Chimpanzee allele) and a randomly
								chosen Denisova allele (Reich et al. 2010) was ancestral (same as
								chimpanzee).

						- Panel 2 “840k”: 842,630 SNPs constituting the rest of the SNPs on the
							Human Origins array, all SNPs on the Illumina 610-Quad array, all
							SNPs on the Affymetrix 50k array, and smaller numbers of SNPs chosen
							for other purposes. See Supplementary Data 1.

		- aim for 120 in first instance
				
		- ascertained only in Euro domestic

			- 30 QTLs
				- GWAS hits 5,981 (NEW == 7,296)
				- ld vs distance / confirm windows size
					- 50 k for SNPS / 100k for neutral
				- 4 flanking / two at random from either side
			
			7,296 * 5 = 36,480
			
			- inc sweep regions from BED file
				- treat the same as QTLs, but with exact window size
					
					- double check the MAF / make sure they're not singletons
				
				(1) 19k SNPs
					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff.bed

					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff_MERGED10kb.bed
				
				- 3 SNPs from regions in (2) but SNPs in (1)
					- with the lowest p-value (i.e. last column in (1))
					= 1k SNPs
			
			
					
			
			- 50 neutrals
				- same ascertainment as above
				
				- not less than 100 kb to nearest gene
					- all geneic regions
						- introns / exons / cpg island (ucsc)
					- possibly contingent on LD result window

				- compare the SFS to discuss

		- 10 ancestral
		
			- do for 2 chinese pops + 1 euro pops
		
			- inc. 10k from Asian
		
			
			- Sumatran scrofa
				- https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r107
		
		- how to computationally resolve positions relative to genes?
			- need to also check all the chrom regions not used (old school QTLs)
			
			- esemble biomart for gene regions
				- cpg islands
				
				- look at
					- /home/laurent/SNP_arrayChickens/pipeline.sh

				- spread across genome
				- exclude exons
				- not near indels
				- not near other SNPs
				- exclude CpG islands
				
				- include OMIA database
