- issues
	- QTL SNPs
	
		- dbsnp 
		- redo with MAF >0.05
	
			- ~23.5 milllion which exist in dbsnp / ~3 million do not
				- what's the frequency?
			- ~350k are called as INDELs in dbsnp / not SNPs
				- +/- width of the bait
				
			- ~60k are polly in dbsnp / bi in my ascertainment
			- ~60k are bi in dbsnp / but alleles are different in my ascertainment
				- what's the frequency?
		
				- total = ~3.5 million problematic SNPs (13%)

			= is it okay to only call SNPs which are
				- SNVs
				- biallelic, and
				- the same alleles in dbsnp

		- existing data
			
			- should we target SNPs with existing coverage?

				- pros
					- includes non-captured samples
					- targets regions we know are recoverable

				- cons
					- hard to simulate

		- what about TV only

			- pros
				- less biased by damage patterns

			- cons
				- ??

			- david reich / check 'Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians' for what they did
				- ts = 80%
				- tv = 20%

	- how to handle non-biallelic sites?
		
***		- only random call from observed alleles!
		
		- currently I'm tossing them away
		- because of the bait design we're already biasing towards the ascertained alleles

		- alternatives

			- random
				- drop random call reads which don't match the biallelic call
				- or, pre-filter for alleles before random calling
				
			- diploid
				- bcftools "--constrain" see https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html
***					- yes, do this!
		

##########################################################################################

		- aim for 120 in first instance
				
		- ascertained only in Euro domestic

			- 30 QTLs
				- GWAS hits 5,981 (NEW == 7,296)
				- ld vs distance / confirm windows size
					- 50 k for SNPS / 100k for neutral
				- 4 flanking / two at random from either side
			
			7,296 * 5 = 36,480
			
***			- inc sweep regions from BED file
				- treat the same as QTLs, but with exact window size
					
					- double check the MAF / make sure they're not singletons
				
				(1) 19k SNPs
					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff.bed
					
				(2) 10kb regions of sweep
					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff_MERGED10kb.bed
				
				- 3 SNPs from regions in (2) but SNPs in (1)
					- with the lowest p-value (i.e. last column in (1))
					= 1k SNPs
			
			
					
			
			- 50 neutrals
				- same ascertainment as above
				
				- not less than 50 kb to nearest gene (may have to be reduced)
					- all geneic regions
						- introns / exons / cpg island (ucsc)
					- possibly contingent on LD result window

				- compare the SFS to discuss

		- 10 ancestral
		
			- do for 2 chinese pops + 1 euro pops
		
			- inc. 10k from Asian
			
			- some GWAS peaks will be non-PorcineSNP60
			
				- Sumatran scrofa
					- https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r107
			
		- how to computationally resolve positions relative to genes?
			- need to also check all the chrom regions not used (old school QTLs)
			
			- esemble biomart for gene regions
				- cpg islands
				
				- look at
					- /home/laurent/SNP_arrayChickens/pipeline.sh

				- spread across genome
				- exclude exons
				- not near indels
				- not near other SNPs
				- exclude CpG islands
				
				- include OMIA database
