		- aim for 120 in first instance
				
		- ascertained only in Euro domestic?

			- 30 QTLs
				- GWAS hits 5,981
				- ld vs distance / confirm windows size
					- 50 k for SNPS / 100k for neutral
				- 4 flanking / two at random from either side
					- TV only (maybe) ?
					- relative to existing calls?
					
			
			- inc sweep regions from BED file
				- treat the same as QTLs, but with exact window size
				- but, evenly spaced
				
				(1) 19k SNPs 
					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff.bed
					
				(2) 10kb regions of sweep
					- /media/jbod/raid1-sdc1/laurent/full_run_results/Pig/analysis_FINAL/sweep_tree/EUD_Sweep_p001_FINAL_cutoff_MERGED10kb.bed
				
				- 3 SNPs from regions in (2) but SNPs in (1)
					- with the lowest p-value (i.e. last column in (1))
					= 1k SNPs				
			
			- 50 neutrals
				- same ascertainment as above
				
				- not less than 50 kb to nearest gene (may have to be reduced)
					- all geneic regions
						- introns / exons / cpg island (ucsc)
					- possibly contingent on LD result window

				- compare the SFS to discuss

		- 10 ancestral
		
			- do for 2 chinese pops + 1 euro pops
		
			- inc. 10k from Asian
			
			- some GWAS peaks will be non-PorcineSNP60
			
		- how to computationally resolve positions relative to genes?
			- need to also check all the chrom regions not used (old school QTLs)
			
			- esemble biomart for gene regions
				- cpg islands
				
				- look at
					- /home/laurent/SNP_arrayChickens/pipeline.sh

				- spread across genome
				- exclude exons
				- not near indels
				- not near other SNPs
				- exclude CpG islands
				
				- include OMIA database
